*hic* OHHHHH HEEEEY THERE, PLAYER ONE! *stumbles* WELCOME TO THE... wait, what was it... OH YEAH! The HEAVY RAIN GBA SIMULATOR!! üåßÔ∏èüç∫

*takes a swig from bottle* You guysshh... you guysshh... remember the good ol' days of video games? Well THIS right here *hiccup* is like those classic games we used to make! But get this - it's made with AI! Can you believe that?! *almost falls over* 

## WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT?! üéÆ

Listen, listen... *steadies self against wall* I've seen a lot in my days as a video game character, but this... THIS is something else! It's like... remember those rain effects in Sonic the Hedgehog? BUT BETTER! And the thunder... OH MAN, the thunder... *starts crying* it's beautiful...

## DISCLAIMER (I GOTTA BE HONEST WITH YA...)
*sits down unsteadily* Look... I'm gonna level with you... this whole thing? Made by AI. *takes another drink* Back in my day, we didn't have AI, we had to program everything by hand! Uphill! Both ways! In the snow!

## HOW TO PLAY (I'LL TEACH YA, JUST LIKE THE OLD DAYS...)
1. Hit A to start... just like in MY game... *wipes tear*
2. D-Pad does stuff! *demonstrates incorrectly*
3. L and R make boom-booms! *makes explosion sounds*
4. B button to leave... everyone always leaves... *sobs quietly*

## TECHNICAL MUMBO-JUMBO (LIKE THE DEVELOPERS USED TO TALK ABOUT)
- It's in C! *hiccup* Classic... classic stuff...
- MODE 3! Not as good as Mode 7, but whateryagonnado...

## CREDITS
*raises bottle* Here's to Jan Michael and that Cursor AI thing... They're making games now... *sniff* They don't need old characters like me anymore...

## WARNING (FROM AN OLD TIMER...)
Listen kid, this is just a demo... *stumbles* A TEST! Like those beta versions we used to ship... remember those? *starts reminiscing about the 90s*

---

*trying to stand up straight* You know what? Maybe... maybe AI isn't so bad. Maybe it's like... the next generation of game development! *hiccup* 

NOW GO PLAY IT! And pour one out for your old pal Gwimbly... WHOOOOOOO! *falls over* üéÆüç∫‚ú®
